# Description
This repository contains all data and code used in my article Working with Survey Data - Clean and Visualize Likert Scale Questions in R. 


## Intro
If you've ever read or written a survey, you've probably encountered Likert type questions. 
These are questions that are answerable on some scale like strongly disagree to strongly agree, or always to never. 
This scale allows us to quantify sentiments that are otherwise subjective. 
Today, we'll discuss how to clean, aggregate, and visualize this type of data.

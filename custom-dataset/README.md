# Description
This repository contains all data and code used in my article [How to Create a Custom Dataset in R](
https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-a-custom-dataset-in-r-cf045e286656).

## Intro
In your data science journey, you might have come across synthetic datasets, sometimes called toy or dummy datasets. 
These are useful for practicing data wrangling, visualizing, and modelling techniques. 
Compared to real world data, they are often clean and easy to understand. 
This makes working with synthetic data an appealing idea for beginners. 
Today, I’ll walk you through how you can make your own synthetic data. 
After reading this article, you’ll be able to create your own big data, with as many variables as you like.

## Intro
Bar graphs are the bread and butter of data visualization. They are useful for comparing values of categorical data.
In tidyverse, you can construct the bar graph below with only two lines of code.

Despite its simple appearance, this graph tells you everything you need to know about the data. If you’re just doing an exploratory data analysis, its modest appearance may be sufficient. However, if you plan to communicate your data through a report or presentation, it may not be enough to draw your reader’s attention. 
Customizing your graph’s aesthetics can improve its readability, draw emphasis to interesting trends, and help your visualization look more professional.
